OMEinfo is an open-source bioinformatics tool designed to automate the retrieval of consistent geographical metadata for microbiome research. It provides an easy-to-use interface for researchers to obtain geographical metadata, including Koppen climate classification, degree of rurality, population density, and fossil fuel CO2 emissions from user-provided location data. The tool aims to facilitate cross-study comparisons and promote reproducibility in microbiome research by adhering to the principles of FAIR and Open data.

## Features

- Dash web application for user-friendly data upload and visualization
- Custom Cloud Optimized GeoTIF file hosted on AWS S3 for efficient data access
- Integration with open data sources, such as Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)
- Portable and lightweight Docker container for easy deployment
- Adheres to FAIR and Open data principles for better reproducibility and collaboration

## Installation

OMEinfo is provided as a Docker container, which can be easily set up in a local environment or on cloud-based platforms. To install and run OMEinfo, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your machine following the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/m-crown/OMEinfo.git`
3. Navigate to the project app directory: `cd OMEinfo/OMEinfo`
4. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t omeinfo .` Note: you may need to prefix this command with sudo.
5. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 8050:8050 omeinfo`

## Usage

1. Open the OMEinfo web application in your browser at `http://0.0.0.0:8050`.
2. Upload a CSV file containing geolocation data (latitude and longitude) using the provided interface. A test addresses file is distributed with the OMEinfo repo , `OMEinfo/test_data`. `test_addresses` is a large sample metadata file, and can take some time to load. `test_addresses2.csv` is a subset of the larger set, and will load in approx 15 seconds. 
3. The application will retrieve the geographical metadata for the uploaded locations and display the results on a map and in a histogram.
4. You can choose to display metadata features as the color coding on the map and as the histogram's x-axis.
5. A table with the processed data is also provided for further analysis. 

## Data Sources

The cloud-optimized GeoTIFF files are stored on AWS S3 following a naming schema that includes the data type, source, and version number. The file names are constructed as follows:

`<data_type><source><version>.tif`

For example:

1. `CO2_v1.tif`
2. `rurpopkop_v1.tif`

When new data becomes available, the version number in the file name is incremented (e.g., `v2`, `v3`, etc.). This allows users to identify and access the most up-to-date version of the data while maintaining the availability of previous versions for reference or reproducibility purposes.

To ensure clear and consistent communication of version updates, a changelog will be maintained in this repository, documenting the dates of version updates and any significant changes in the data.

### Current Data Sources
